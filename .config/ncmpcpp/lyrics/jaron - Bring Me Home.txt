I'd be ridin' in a cab goin' downtown
Findin' faces I know in a big crowd
Tryin' to drink the pain away, mhmm
And I'd be stayin' out all night, never goin' home
Girl you know I'd lose all control
If I lost you

There would be a riot
Breakin' of my heart, I'd try to fight it
I could go out every night but I'd be lyin'
If I said I could live and breathe
Without you
There'd be a lot of lonely
Wishin' and prayin' that you would hold me
I would do most anything baby
If only you would come back to me
Come back to me
There would be a riot
Oh yeah, oooh

I'd be checkin' on my phone every minute
Waitin' 'round for it to start ringin'
And prayin' it would be you
I don't know what I'd do

There would be a riot
Breakin' of my heart, I'd try to fight it
I could go out every night but I'd be lyin'
If I said I could live and breathe
Without you
There'd be a lot of lonely
Wishin' and prayin' that you would hold me
I would do most anything baby if only
You would come back to me
Come back to me
There would be a riot
If I ever lost you
If I ever lost you

There would be a riot
Breakin' of my heart, I'd try to fight it
I could go out every night but I'd be lyin'
If I said I could live and breathe
There'd be a lot of lonely
Wishin' and prayin' that you would hold me
I would do most anything baby if only
You would come back to me
Come back to me
There would be a riot
If I ever lost you

There would be, there would be a riot
Breakin' of my heart, I'd try to fight it
There would be a riot
If I ever lost you
